    <div>As Tommie’s day ends she finds herself waiting on campus for training afterschool. class gets out at 3:30 and it’s prime time for socialization with the other teams. As soon as she is about to approach the basketball team she hears something in the distance that sounds like a herd of elephants. It’s the football team running through the halls, on their way through they pick Tommie up and she starts crowd surfing. They end up carrying her all the way through the school for half an hour.
